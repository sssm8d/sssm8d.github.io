	<h1>neutriNO!!</h1>
	<h2>Neutrinos are not real; they are lying to us</h2>
	<p>Scientists claim that they can detect these new particles "neutrinos". Over 500 experiments have been performed ant funded by the US government in order to seek out these "ghost particles". These are not scientists, and more sinister, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR NEUTRINOS.</p>
	<h2>The written History</h2>
	<p>Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are extremely difficult to detect due to their extremely small mass and lack of charge. They were first proposed in 1930 by physicist Wolfgang Pauli, and were later "discovered" by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. The dawn of neutrino experiments were closely tied to post world war 2 American 
	nuclear weapons fabrication. This is no coincidence.</p>
	<p> These locations were supposedly chosen because the running reactor, that were being used to 
	create Plutonium for nuclear weapons, would create enough neutrinos from those nuclear 
	reactions to be detected by these experiments placed close by.  But these experiments become 
	much more sinister when you realize that there are no neutrinos. 
	</p>

	<p>These experiments allowed these scientists and their colliegs access to some of the 
	governments most secure locations. Places guarded by armed men and requiring the highest of 
	security clearances. Neutrino experiments were a convinient excuse for these men, likely 
	Russian agents, to acces these spaces. Not only could they access the cites, but had they 
	brought with them literal tons of equipment, see picture below. This equipment was actually the 
	highest quality surveillance equipment, including cameras, listening devices, and chemical and 
	radiation detectors, disguised as physics equipment, that could be used to reverse engineer  the 
	US’s nuclear enrichment methods. </p>
	<h2>"Physics" of neutrinos</h2>
	<p>A basic concept in particle physics is flavor conservation. Particles have properties called flavors, and there must be the same amount of a flavor at the beginning and end something. The theory of neutrino oscillations undermine this concept when they say that neutrinos can change their flavor. The DUNE experiment claims they will start with a beam of muon neutrinos in Chicago and detect electron neutrinos in South Dacota. The laws of physics say this is impossible. The diagram shows the supposed reactions that happen in Chicago and South Dacota. </p>

	<p>Conveniently, scientists say neutrinos can not be directly detected, meaning no one has ever seen one for themselves. I find this a laughably clear indication that they are lying to us, and that these particles don’t exist in the first place.</p>
	<h2>"Facts" about Neutrinos:</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Neutrinos have a very small, but non-zero mass. Conveinient</li>
	  <li>They interact very weakly with other matter, making them difficult to detect. Event more conveinient.</li>
	  <li>Neutrinos are estimated to be the second most abundant particle in the universe, after photons. Then where are they</li>
	  <li>Neutrinos are produced by nuclear reactions, such as those in the sun and other stars. Of course they want anothre reason to study nuclear reactions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The DUNE Experiment</h2>
	<p>One of the more recent additions to the onslaught of neutriNO experiments is the DUNE experiment. This is a supposed Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, that claims to be shooting a beam of neutrinos through the Earth from FermiLab to a mine in South Dacota. In SD, they are currently excavating giant caverns to house this experiment and its detectors, as well as a smaller hole in the Chicago area. </p>
	<p>The question: What is the government really doing in these underground layers?</p>
	<p>No one other than these supposed scientists are going to have access to this mine, so what is really happening down there. The clues include the need for space underground, the need for 2 locations and the DUNE acronym itself. The government has long used 2 sided acronyms to prevent the leaking of information. If enemy agents or concerned citizens learn of the DUNE program, but are fed a false narrative about the meaning, their concerns can be more easily dismissed.</p>
	<h3>DUNE - Detention for Unregistered Nuclear Extremists</h3>

	<p>I believe that these holes are prisons, for enemies of the state. Specifically those that have smuggled nuclear materials into the United States inside their person. These Nuclear Mules were sent in with enough material and knowledge to make dirty bombs. These were highly dangerous individuals, given they could work alone and given the radiation they were exposed to through conveying the materials, were already destined to die.</p> 
	<p>The US government learned of these terrorist threats only after their airport nuclear monitors had gone off (yes, the airports are monitored for nuclear activity). </p>
